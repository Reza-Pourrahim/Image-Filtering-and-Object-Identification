# Image Filtering and Object Identification
 
basic image filtering is being implemented to an image using the NumPy and pandas. Filtering is subjected to an image in order to achieve outputs such as smoothing (reducing the noise), enhancement (improving the contrast), to extract information about edges or corners and also to detect image patterns.
In the identification part, query images are being compared the images with different distance functions such as the intersection distance, the Euclidean distance and the chi-square distance. The functions are evaluated through their performance in combination with the different types of image representation.
